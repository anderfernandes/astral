## Open Source CRM for Planetariums

### About

Astral will be a system that will allow non-profit organizations (such as Planetariums, Science Theaters, Science Centers and Museums) to have a database of shows, create events, sell tickets for those events and report sales. The system at first will not process payments online. It requires your organization to have a credit card machine. It is being currently developed by Anderson Fernandes. If you would like to contact me about this project, my Twitter is @anderfernandes1.

### Thanks

I would like to thank Prof. Chad Burrows for his help with this project, as well as Fed Chavez, Clifford Bailey, David Cantwell, Killian Brooks and Donald Hubbs for their ideas and my mother for hanging out with me while I work on this almost every evening.

### Contributing

Pull requests will not be taken at this moment because the system is at a very early stage of development. Anderson works on this project on his free time so it may take a while until we are accepting pull requests.
