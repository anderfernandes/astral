We help people run small and medium non-profit educational centers so that they can focus on inspiring and teaching the wonders of science and the universe to the communities they serve.

Astral is an open source point of sale (POS), customer relationship manager (CRM),
box office, membership, marketing and reservation manager for non-profit educational organizations
such as planetariums, science centers and museums. It helps them:

- Run a point of sale for tickets and products
- Generate sale, invoices and receipts
- Generate attendance and revenue reports
- Manage events, shows, products, memberships, users, organizations and work shifts
- Schedule and manage events such as school field trips, birthday parties, special events, civic events, etc, with automated email and/or in app notifications
- Calendar view with past, present and future events and sales
- Send automated marketing emails such as newsletters, reminders and alerts to members, teachers and visitors
- Process credit card payments online

Astral runs straight from modern browsers in smartphones, tablets, PC, MacOS or Linux.

If you work in a non-profit planetarium, museum or science center and are struggling to find the right app to help you run things, Astral is what you are looking for.

## Thanks

I would like to thank my mother for keeping me company and encouraging me when I first started this project back in 2017. Fred Chavez, Clifford Bailey, Prof. Chad Burrows, Prof. Matt Lyles, Killian Brooks, David Cantwell, Donald Hubbs, Daniel Kahn, Anjelicca Spruce, James Martin Jr. and Desiree Bates helped me with ideas and reporting bugs. Last but not least, extended thanks to my best friend Dani and his sister Che, Chachis, Thomas, Mauri and their families for pretty much adopting me along with Mikey, Rafa, Marcial, Choko, Diego, Javi, Sandro, Adriana, Yoli and Abuela for always treating me like family.
