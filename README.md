## Thanks

I would like to thank my mother for keeping me company and encouraging me when I first started this project back in 2017. Fred Chavez, Clifford Bailey, Prof. Chad Burrows, Prof. Matt Lyles, Killian Brooks, David Cantwell, Donald Hubbs, Daniel Kahn, Anjelicca Spruce, James Martin Jr. and Desiree Bates helped me with ideas and reporting bugs. Last but not least, extended thanks to my best friend Dani and his sister Che, Chachis, Thomas, Mauri and their families for pretty much adopting me along with Mikey, Rafa, Marcial, Choko, Diego, Javi, Sandro, Adriana, Yoli and Abuela for always treating me like family.
