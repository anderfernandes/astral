# Introduction

Astral helps small and medium non-profit planetariums, museums and science centers teach the wonders of science and the universe to the communities they serve. It does that by helping these organizations manage their events, sales, visitors and memberships.

## Why Astral

Teaching is one of the best things an individual or organization can do to make the world a better place. That is the thought that led to the creating of Astral.

When our point of sale software couldn't be used anymore because it was too old and all possible replacements were terrible in addition to asking for way too much, Astral was created and made free and open source from the beginning so that it can help organizations that find themselves in the same situation, or are just tired of something that help them focus on their visitors and costs too much.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to setup Astral is to clone the repo, build the `server` and `ui` containers and run the latter behind a proxy.

Astral can be served from any Windows or Linux that can run containers as well as cloud services like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, etc.
